# Mandelbrot

A point c in the complex plane is said to belong to the Mandelbrot set if the sequence z[n+1] = z[n]^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from starting point z[0] = (0,0).

Thus we iterate z[n] a fixed number of times and register at what iteration the value of z[n] exceeded a specific threshold, if any. 

Every character space of the Ubuntu console is treated as a pixel and colored according to the loop exiting value.
